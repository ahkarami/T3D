# Temporal 3D ConvNet (T3D)

Temporal 3D ConvNet

This is the code for the paper entitled: Temporal 3D ConvNets: New Architecture and Transfer Learning for Video Classification,
Ali Diba, Mohsen Fayyaz, Vivek Sharma, Amir Hossein Karami, Mohammad Mahdi Arzani, Rahman Yousefzadeh, Luc Van Gool.

In fact, In this work we have introduced the new 3D convolutional neural network architectures for video classification named DenseNet3D and T3D. 

Other codes will be available soon.
